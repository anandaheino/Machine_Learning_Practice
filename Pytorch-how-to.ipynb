    "# Introduction to PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "- [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) it's a framework for developing and training neural networks. \n",
    "- It's very similar to numpy, but here, `array` is called `tensors`\n",
    "- `tensors` make the communication between CPU and GPU much easier than `arrays`\n",
    "- also, pytorch has usefull functions to calculate gradients (which is great for backpropagation tasks) and build neural networks\n",
    "- compared with tensorflow and other frameworks, pytorch is better to work with python / numpy / scipy\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple machine learning models (e.g. like perceptron, and linear and logistic regression) must solve linear equations like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "y &= f(w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b) \\\\\n",
    "y &= f\\left(\\sum_i w_i x_i +b \\right)\n",

    "\n",
    "- Linear algebra with `tensors`, matrix genaralization, and other math areas are  exactly what machine algorithms do..\n",
    "   - vector is a 1D tensor\n",
    "   - matrix is a 2D tensor\n",
    "   - a 3D array is a 3D tensor (e.g. RBG images)\n"
